# SJDB Query Optimiser

## Introduction
This project was one of my coursework assignments at university. The aim of this project is to build a query optimiser for SJDB, a simple relational database management system (RDBMS). The optimiser accepts a canonical query plan and constructs an optimised left-deep query plan that minimises the sizes of any intermediate relations.

## Features
- Implementation of a cost estimator for query plans
- Construction of an optimised query plan
- Demonstration of the optimiser on various input queries
